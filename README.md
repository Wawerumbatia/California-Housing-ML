# California Housing Price Prediction 🏠

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning to predict median house values in California districts. Moving beyond basic theory, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), handled data outliers, and compared different regression models.

## 📊 Key Insights from Data
* **Top Predictor:** Median Income (`MedInc`) is the strongest driver of house prices.
* **Correlation:** It has a high positive correlation of **0.69**.
* **Data Cleaning:** Removed "censored" data points where prices were capped at $500,000.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
